# MaliciousVBA

I was reading various articles on how other go about bypassing AMSI using VBA. A great article can be found on this blog [codewhitesec](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2019/07/heap-based-amsi-bypass-in-vba.html).

Instead of trying to replicate that I chose a different route. I tried to use the powershell command Invoke-Experession to download [Nikhil's](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1) reverse shell script.
